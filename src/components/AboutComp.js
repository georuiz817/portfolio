I was able to thrive in hands on experience with topics like team building, data management, and corporate best practices.</p> <br> <p>When given a suggestion that I should look into Web Development, I immediately started to do my research. I completed every course possible. Codecademy, Khan Academy, and Free Code Camp were no exceptions. I decided at this point to open up my horizons and enroll in Flatiron Schools Full Stack Web Development boot camp. Six months of team work, independent work, and training on both Front and Back end development has given me the opportunity to display an array of exciting and even some silly portfolio projects.</p>'

Free courses, Youtube, W3Schools, and searching through the internet are a few ways I have been practicing anything new and exciting.</p> <br> The most important way has been actually coding with them. Any new project I make has been implementing some new tool. Some examples are React Hooks, Sass, Vue, Node.js`
